# About this program
This is a simple Animal Matching Game developed in C#. The game challenges players to match pairs of animal images by clicking on them. 
When two matching images are selected, they remain visible; otherwise, they are hidden again. The game continues until all pairs are matched.

This program was created as a learning experience from the book "Head First C#" by Andrew Stellman and Jennifer Greene.  
It demonstrates basic concepts of C# programming, including event handling, image manipulation, and user interface design.

(And WOW is either IntelliJ or GitHub Copilot trying to just write everything for me (even this!)).

## Features
(coming...)
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Randomized placement of animal images for each game
- Visual feedback for matched and unmatched pairs
- Score tracking based on the number of attempts
- Restart option to play again
- Timer to track how long it takes to complete the game
