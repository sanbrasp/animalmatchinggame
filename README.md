This project will be following Chapter 1 in the book, creating a basic game where you click to pair up two 
equal pictures.

As a fresh C# learner, who has at this very second read 40 pages of this book, I highly recommend it if you 
like humour and a fresh take on how to present and teach a tough subject that can and will try to be very dry!  
The pictures, text in pictures, and the presentation is brilliant, funny, and very easy to follow!

Let this be my shameless book promotion because it is well deserved and any C# learner would greatly benefit from 
owning a copy.
